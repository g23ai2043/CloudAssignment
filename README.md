# Create a web application using Docker from scratch

## Description
This project demonstrates setting up a Python server locally to serve static files (index.html and styles.css). Additionally, it includes instructions on Dockerizing the static website using nginx to provide a portable and isolated environment for hosting the same static content.
Provide a brief overview of your project. Mention its purpose and what problem it solves.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the static web server and Dockerized webpage:

### 1. Set Up the Python Web Server

First, set up the Python web server using `server.py` to serve static files:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/static-web-server.git
cd Docker/

# Run the Python server (in a separate terminal)
python server.py
'''

### 2. Run docker build command

'''  
# docker build -t abhi-web-app .
 '''
